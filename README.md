# Impressions

## My B.Sc. (App.Sc.) <a href="https://corner.practicalcoder.com/impression.html" target="_blank">research project</a> was a study of cryptography. 

This script demonstrates the mechanics of one way hashing and symmetric encryption. 

Decrypt the text to see an ascii art ``impression`` (Caveat* If aligned correctly in your browser). Using an image like this is a nod to stenography, i.e. hiding in plain sight, an out of band method for data security. 

##### *nb Text area width renders can vary by browser, impression alignment isn't guaranteed.  This this is not a compatibility layer, check out the page source if you're interested.
