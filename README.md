# Impressions

## My B.Sc. (App.Sc.) research project was a study of cryptography. 

This script demonstrates the mechanics of one way hashing and symmetric encryption. 

Decrypt the text to see an <a href="https://corner.practicalcoder.com/impression.html" target="_blank">ascii art ``impression`` </a> Encoding an image like this is called stenography, i.e. hiding in plain sight, an out of band method for data security. 

##### *nb Impression alignment is tested against popular browsers and OSs but isn't guaranteed. Alignment controls were added to mitigate this. 

The same digest symmetric key protocol is used by <a href="https://send.firefox.com/">Firefox Send</a>. It's interesting to see proof that data security protocols stand over time.
