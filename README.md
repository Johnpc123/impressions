# Impressions

## My B.Sc. (App.Sc.) software engineering research project was a study of cryptography. 

This script demonstrates the mechanics of one way hashing and symmetric encryption. 

Decrypt the text to see an ascii art ``impression`` (Caveat* If aligned correctly in your browser). Using an image like this is a nod to stenography, i.e. hiding in plain sight, an out of band method for data security. 

##### *nb impression alignment isn't guaranteed, this is not a compatibility layer.
