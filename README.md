## My B.Sc. (App.Sc.) research project was a study of cryptography. 

This script demonstrates the mechanics of one way hashing, symmetric encryption and stenography (i.e. hiding in plain sight, an out of band method for data security).

Decrypt the text to see an <a href="https://corner.practicalcoder.com/impression.html" target="_blank">ascii art impression </a>

The same digest symmetric key protocol is used by <a href="https://send.firefox.com/">Firefox Send</a>. It's interesting to see proof that data security protocols stand over time.
